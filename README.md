Just a simple game coded on Godot 4 in C#. Based on one of my favorite games, [Boson X](https://store.steampowered.com/app/302610/Boson_X/?curator_clanid=44870706).

## Rules

You need to jump from one platform to another. When you walk on a blue platform, your speed and energy percentage will increase. To beat the game, you need to have 100% energy.

When you reach 100%, you can accumulate more energy. Good luck!

## Controls

- **Arrow keys**: Use the left and right arrow keys to move.

- **Jump**: Press the space bar to jump.

## Features

- **Procedural Generation**: There is only one level which is generated procedurally, providing a unique experience each time you play.
